## What is Techverse MFA?

Techverse (T-MFA) is a Multi-factor Authenticator tool that validates application users through an active authentication process. The framework can efficiently authorise legitimate users through biometrics, OTP, and location: hence, filling the existing functionality, reliability, and security void in the authentication technology industry.

### Why Techverse MFA?

#### Strict Security Policy
While various Multi-Factor Authenticator technologies reduce the risk of exploitation through client-side vulnerabilities, threat actors can still have their way through brute force methods. With Techverse MFAs, strict access control configurations and compliance are implemented from the server and client side to ensure user protection.


*** Techverse Security Features

- Supports a location-based algorithm protocol that validates login when the user browser and authenticator app location match.

- It provides a one-time mnemonic passphrase for account recovery during sign-up.

- It Supports biometric sign-in.

- Initiates account lockout threshold policy after three attempts.

- Time-based OTP feature duration is lesser to demoralise attackers.



#### Tested Reliability

Backup and Simple Migration

Aside from password recovery in the case of loss or change of device, Techverse Authenticator supports secure and convenient backup and transfer. With the Techverse framework, the original device can verify the legitimacy of the new device before generating and storing new slots for MFA on it.
